    "The overall trend of people diagnosed with the coronavirus during 2021 is an almost constant increase, with a few ups and downs in between. The highest number of new cases in 2021 was around 200,000 persons per day. Although the daily number of new cases does not fluctuate too much and seems to be decreasing recently (July 2022), the sudden increase in January 2022 was rather drastic, equalling almost 3 to 4 times of the relative peak values in other months.\n",

Important coincidences with the case observation to notice are that similar to new cases, the peak and valley data points of deaths occurred in January 2022 and July 2021 as well. Note that the scale of the two diagrams vary. While the number of new cases a day can be up to almost 800,000, the maximum daily deaths is less than 3,500 persons."

Comparing the percentage of people at home in April 2020 with the percentage in November 2021 shows the change in numbers between counties in the US. \n",

    "By comparing the data on the number of people's trips between 2019, 2020 and 2021, we can see the impact of COVID-19 on people's travel. First, analyze the distribution of the number of trips. More than half of people have 0 to 3 daily trips. The number of trips from 3 to 5, 5 to 10 and 10 to 25 is basically the same, and their combined share is more than 40%, and only a few people make more than 25 trips per day. In 2019, the number of people's trips remained in a relatively stable range. The overall trend is that the number of trips in the middle of the year is slightly higher than that at the beginning and end of the year. When the outbreak of COVID-19 hit in March 2020, the number of people's travel dropped significantly and has remained at a relatively low level compared to 2019. In 2021, the number of people's trips will gradually pick up."

    "Canada and Mexico border the northern and southern parts of the U.S., respectively, so observing the changes in the number of their cross-border vehicles can deduce the impact of COVID-19 on the travel of passenger vehicles in the northern and southern parts of the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that before COVID-19, which is the baseline in the figure, the number of passenger vehicles transiting between Canada and the U.S. fluctuated between 400k and 700k, and when COVID-19 emerged, there was a significant drop in the number of those, reaching a minimum value of even less than 50k. And then, until August 2021, the number of transit vehicles had not risen significantly and remained at a low level. However, after that, the number of transit vehicles began to increase and recover towards the pre-epidemic situation, although it still did not end up where it was before.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of transit vehicles between Mexico and the U.S. has been showing an overall upward trend after the same significant drop as in the north at the beginning of COVID-19. Around April 2022, the number of passenger vehicles crossing in the south has reached its previous value, and even slightly more than before, which differs dramatically from the recovery of the northern border crossing.\n",
    "Overall, the similarity between the changes in transit vehicles on the northern and southern borders is that initially the number of transit vehicles on both borders dropped significantly due to the travel restrictions imposed on people entering both borders during the highly contagious phase of COVID-19; for example, travel for tourism, shopping, and routine family visits were not allowed. The difference between them is that traffic on the southern border has declined significantly less than that on the southern border, and has recovered faster and better, which is due to more cross-border employment near the southern border.\n"

    "Freight transportation remains an important sector of the transportation industry. This part of analysis aims to process the data on freight transportation in the U.S. to reflect changes in the demand for goods and services before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n",

    "From the diagram, it can clearly be seen that unlike passengers, the quantity of goods being transported in all types did not experience a sharp decrease during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather, most of the freight transportation modes increased during this time. For instance, the air freight increased significantly from mid-2020 to the start of 2022, though it kept decreasing slightly until July 2022. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the two modes of rail freight, the changes are not that apparent, however they both have increased as the pandemic lasted, after they initially decreased in the first few months of the pandemic. The tonnage of truck freight seems to be rather unchanged throughout 2020 to 2022, as the numbers only fluctuated very slightly."

On the other hand, for new COVID-19 deaths, the waterborne and truck freight are slightly negatively correlated with it (-0.27 and -0.2, respectively).
